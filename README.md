# M226a-DwarvenGold
A small game for M226a made using Greenfoot

## The Game
The game is about a dwarf mining his way through the earth in hopes of finding gold and other valuables. To make the game interesting, there will be enemys that randomly spawn while mining. Once you get killed or the pickaxe breaks, the game will end and you get a score.

The world is randomly generated and each time you play will be a little different.
